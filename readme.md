Ever since Buddy was conceived we wanted to deliver a service that could be installed on-premises: there are many companies who cannot use a cloud solution and would rather keep stuff in-house, usually because of regulations regarding code storage.

That's how Buddy GO was born, a fully-functional, Docker based version of Buddy with exactly the same (and a few extra) features as the cloud version and a dedicated support for GitHub Enterprise and GitLab self-hosted. If you're a Buddy GO user, here's a couple of things you might want to know.

## Sandboxes go self-hosted

{% warning %}

**UPDATE**: December 2018

After one year of testing, we have decided to shut down the beta of Sandboxes. Using the feedback that we gathered, we are currently working on a new and improved version of the test environment feature. Make sure to [**follow us on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/BuddyGit) for news and updates on the release date.

{% endwarning %}

We're currently working on Sandboxes that will allow you to run apps without the need of setting up a server. Since we announced the Beta two weeks ago, we have received numerous requests about its availability on Buddy standalone.

**We do confirm that Sandboxes will be available on self-hosted, just like every other feature of the cloud version.**

{% info %}

At the same time, we'd like to invite all standalone users to a private beta. If you're interested, drop an email to **<sandboxes@buddy.works>** with "standalone" in the subject. When the beta rolls out, we will activate the feature on your machine.

## Buddy goes Enterprise

As cool as Buddy GO might sound, we needed a more universal name that will be immediately ring a bell for new users about the nature of the tool. We've decided to go for Enterprise, an industry standard when it comes to naming on-premises software installations. The change is purely cosmetical and doesn't require any action from your side.
